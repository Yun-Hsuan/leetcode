It should be a good place for newcomers to get familiarized with some of the key ideas in the field, specially regarding the numerics. After a very general introduction we motivate the concept of tensor network and provide several examples. We then move on to explain some basics about Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). Selected details on some of the associated numerical methods for 1 d and 2 d quantum lattice systems are also discussed. "

The first rigorous example of an isotropic model in such a phase is presented. The Hamiltonian has an exactSO(3) symmetry and is translationally invariant, but we prove the model has a unique ground state, a gap in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian immediately above the ground state and exponential decay of the correlation functions in the ground state. Models in two and higher dimension which are expected to have the same properties are also presented. For these models we construct an exact ground state, and for some of them we prove that the two-point function decays exponentially in this ground state. In all these models exact ground states are constructed by using valence bonds.",

	abstract={In this paper, we propose an exotic quantum paramagnetic state in two-dimensional antiferromagnets—the spontaneous trimer state—which is the direct product state of the trimers of spins. Each trimer is a singlet state formed by three neighboring spins with SU (3) symmetry. A frustrated spin-1 Heisenberg model in the kagome lattice is investigated. By analogy to the pseudo-potential approach in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), we find that the trimer state provides a good description for the exact ground state of this model. Other interesting properties, such as the local excitations as well as magnetization plateaus have also been investigated.}

	abstract={We present an object-oriented open-source library for developing tensor network algorithms written in C++ called Uni10. With Uni10, users can build a symmetric tensor from a collection of bonds, while the bonds are constructed from a list of quantum numbers associated with different quantum states. It is easy to label and permute the indices of the tensors and access a block associated with a particular quantum number. Furthermore a network class is used to describe arbitrary tensor network structure and to perform network contractions efficiently. We give an overview of the basic structure of the library and the hierarchy of the classes. We present examples of the construction of a spin-1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the implementation of the tensor renormalization group algorithm to illustrate the basic usage of the library. The library described here is particularly well suited to explore and fast prototype novel tensor network algorithms and to implement highly efficient codes for existing algorithms.}
