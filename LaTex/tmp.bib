	abstract = {An Ising system is constructed by stacking frustrated antiferromagnetic triangular lattices. Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson and Monte Carlo analyses suggest two ordered phases. In the low-temperature phase, one sublattice is fully ordered and, oppositely, two sublattices are partially ordered. In the intermediate phase, two sublattices are fully and oppositely ordered, and one is disordered. The transition to the paramagnetic phase is in {XY} universality. The transition between the ordered phases is due to sixfold symmetry-breaking flop.},

Beginning with a brief review of phase transitions in simple systems and of mean field theory, the text then goes on to introduce the core ideas of the renormalization group. Following chapters cover phase diagrams, fixed points, cross-over behavior, finite-size scaling, perturbative renormalization methods, low-dimensional systems, surface critical behavior, random systems, percolation, polymer statistics, critical dynamics and conformal symmetry. The book closes with an appendix on Gaussian integration, a selected bibliography, and a detailed index. Many problems are included. The emphasis throughout is on providing an elementary and intuitive approach. In particular, the perturbative method introduced leads, among applications, to a simple derivation of the epsilon expansion in which all the actual calculations (at least to lowest order) reduce to simple counting, avoiding the need for Feynman diagrams.},

In simulations the periodic boundary conditions and the Metropolis algorithm are used.

For these couplings the critical exponent yh is calculated analyzing the magnetic susceptibility in the framework of the finite-size scaling with corrections.

	abstract = {We report the details and revised analysis of an experiment to measure the specific heat of helium with subnanokelvin temperature resolution near the lambda point. The measurements were made at the vapor pressure spanning the region from 22 {mK} below the superfluid transition to 4{μK} above. The experiment was performed in Earth orbit to reduce the rounding of the transition caused by gravitationally induced pressure gradients on Earth. Specific-heat measurements were made deep in the asymptotic region to within 2 {nK} of the transition. No evidence of rounding was found to this resolution. The optimum value of the critical exponent describing the specific-heat singularity was found to be α=-0.0127±0.0003. This is bracketed by two recent estimates based on renormalization-group techniques, but is slightly outside the range of the error of the most recent result. The ratio of the coefficients of the leading-order singularity on the two sides of the transition is A+/A-=1.053±0.002, which agrees well with a recent estimate. By combining the specific-heat and superfluid density exponents a test of the Josephson scaling relation can be made. Excellent agreement is found based on high-precision measurements of the superfluid density made elsewhere. These results represent the most precise tests of theoretical predictions for critical phenomena to date.},

	abstract = {We consider various sufficiently nonlinear vector models of ferromagnets, of nematic liquid crystals and of nonlinear lattice gauge theories with continuous symmetries. We show, employing the method of Reflection Positivity and Chessboard Estimates, that they all exhibit first-order transitions in the temperature, when the nonlinearity parameter is large enough. The results hold in dimension 2 or more for the ferromagnetic models and the {RP} N −1 liquid crystal models and in dimension 3 or more for the lattice gauge models. In the two-dimensional case our results clarify and solve a recent controversy about the possibility of such transitions. For lattice gauge models our methods provide the first proof of a first-order transition in a model with a continuous gauge symmetry.},

This model has recently been shown to describe hydrogen-induced reconstruction on the W(100) surface. Based on mean-field and renormalization-group arguments, we first show how the interplay between the anisotropy fields can give rise to different phase transitions in the model. When the fields are compatible with each other there is a continuous phase transition when the fourth-order field is varied from negative to positive values. This transition becomes discontinuous at low temperatures. These two regimes are separated by a multicritical point. In the case of competing four- and eightfold fields, the first-order transition at low temperatures opens up into two Ising transitions. We then use numerical methods to accurately locate the position of the multicritical point, and to verify the nature of the transitions. The different techniques used include Monte Carlo histogram methods combined with finite-size scaling analysis, the real-space Monte Carlo renormalization-group method, and the Monte Carlo transfer-matrix method. Our numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical arguments.},

By the imposition of suitable boundary conditions it is shown how to define explicitly a helicity modulus Υ(T) which measures the free-energy increment associated with "twisting" the direction of the order parameter. For a Bose system the superfluid density is seen to be ρs(T)=(mℏ)2Υ(T). A critical exponent v is defined by Υ(T)∼{\textbar}T−Tc{\textbar}v as T→Tc; for an ideal Bose gas and spherical model (n→∞), v=1 is an exact result for all d{\textgreater}2. The difficulties of defining a correlation length in the ordered phase are discussed. A full scaling theory of the correlations avoids these problems and may be linked to a phenomenological hydrodynamic approach, to clarify and rederive Josephson's relation v=2β−ην=2−α−2ν. This reduces to v=(d−2)ν (used by some authors with d=3), only if one accepts d-dependent, "hyperscaling" relations such as dν=2−α; however, both these latter relations fail for the ideal Bose gas when d{\textgreater}4. An alternative derivation of the formula v=2−α−2ν is based on the scaling theory for systems with a large but finite dimension.},

The choice of different interaction energies (±J,±J′) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature T=Tc given by the condition sinh(2JkTc) sinh(2J′{kTc})=1. The energy is a continuous function of T; but the specific heat becomes infinite as −log ∣∣T−Tc∣∣. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with log n. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is (exp (2JkT) tanh(2J′{kT}))n.},

In the integrable model, it is found that the chiral fields are almost proportional to one another. Here we consider a chiral model with all the chiral fields exactly proportional to one another with fixed proportionality constants given by the integrable case. This reduces the chiral field variables to just one denoted by Δ. The model thus defined includes the generalized clock model or {ZN} model (at Δ = 0 or 12) and the chiral clock models as special cases. Using the results of many authors on the {ZN} model in the so-called symmetric case (with vertical and horizontal interactions equal), and the behavior of the system at T = 0, we can get a pretty good picture of the phase diagram of this chiral model. The exact results show that the commonly held belief that the massless phase in the {ZN} model for N ≥ 5 is in the same universality class as the classical {XY} model and the belief that the commensurate-incommensurate phase transition is of the Pokrovskii—Talapov type and the incommensurate-fluid transition is of Kosterlitz—Thouless type may not be correct, as universality may not even hold on these phase boundaries.},

Using the finite-size scaling relation between the magnetization, the temperature and the size of the system, the method of calculation of the critical exponent yh is proposed. Our preliminary results obtained for yh suggest a nonuniversal behavior, similarly as it was observed in the 2D case. Its value seems to change continuously in some interval approaching the Ising value near to all the tricritical points except one. (© 2006 {WILEY}-{VCH} Verlag {GmbH} \& Co. {KGaA}, Weinheim)},

The subject plays a central role in the study of the electrical and magnetic properties of numerous important solid state materials. The author begins by developing the theory of quantum phase transitions in the simplest possible class of non-disordered, interacting systems - the quantum Ising and rotor models. Particular attention is paid to their non-zero temperature dynamic and transport properties in the vicinity of the quantum critical point. Several other quantum phase transitions of increasing complexity are then discussed and clarified. Throughout, the author interweaves experimental results with presentation of theoretical models, and well over 500 references are included. The book will be of great interest to graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics.},

A numerical study of the Migdal recursion relation suggests that models with short-range isotropic interactions rapidly become equivalent to a simplified model system proposed by Villain. A series of exact transformations then allows us to treat the Villain model analytically at low temperatures. To lowest order in a parameter which becomes exponentially small with decreasing temperature, we reproduce results obtained previously by Kosterlitz. We also examine the effect of symmetry-breaking crystalline fields on the isotropic planar model. A numerical study of the Migdal recursion scheme suggests that these fields (which must occur in real quasi-two-dimensional crystals) are strongly relevant variables, leading to critical behavior distinct from that found for the planar model. However, a more exact low-temperature treatment of the Villain model shows that hexagonal crystalline fields eventually become irrelevant at temperatures below the Tc of the isotropic model. Isotropic planar critical behavior should be experimentally accessible in this case. Nonuniversal behavior may result if cubic crystalline fields dominate the symmetry breaking. Interesting duality transformations, which aid in the analysis of symmetry-breaking fields are also discussed.},

This is followed by an analysis of the Helmholtz free energy of a van der Waals gas. Although the van der Waals equation does not satisfy does the stability conditions over the entire range, many of the conclusions are applicable to real systems. For example, a point on a P-T coexistence liquid-vapor diagram would on an A vs. or μ vs. V diagram exhibit two minima, one at a liquid volume and one at a gaseous volume. A curve connecting the two minima must go through a maximum and is unstable. If, due to fluctuations, a system finds itself at such a maximum the system is unstable; and will split into two phases. The minima get shallower the closer the system is to the critical point, and eventually merge into one minimum, resulting in large fluctuations It is pointed out that fluctuations, normally ignored in macroscopic thermodynamics, appear to play a vital role in the critical region. This discussion sets the stage for the treatment of statistical mechanics in the next chapters.},

The precise and detailed analyses of the system’s behavior at the ends of the lines of Ising-like phase transitions are performed and the corrected phase diagram in these regions is presented and discussed. The localizations of the tricritical points are also given. The specific behavior of the Binder cumulant when crossing a bifurcation point has been discovered and interpreted. Some general conclusions on methods of investigation of the critical behavior of a system with a multicomponent order parameter are closing the paper.},

The most important example is the transition of the S=1/2 square lattice antiferromagnet between the Néel state (which breaks spin rotation invariance) and the paramagnetic valence bond solid (which preserves spin rotation invariance but breaks lattice symmetries). We show that these two states are separated by a second-order quantum phase transition. This conflicts with Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory, which predicts that such states with distinct broken symmetries are generically separated either by a first-order transition, or by a phase with co-existing orders. The critical theory of the second-order transition is not expressed in terms of the order parameters characterizing either state, but involves fractionalized degrees of freedom and an emergent, topological, global conservation law. A closely related theory describes the superfluid-insulator transition of bosons at half filling on a square lattice, in which the insulator has a bond density wave order. Similar considerations are shown to apply to transitions of antiferromagnets between the valence bond solid and the Z2 spin liquid: the critical theory has deconfined excitations interacting with an emergent U(1) gauge force. We comment on the broader implications of our results for the study of quantum criticality in correlated electron systems.},

We report results in three and two dimensions. We discuss the crossover phenomena that are observed in this class of systems. In particular, we review the field-theoretical and numerical studies of systems with medium-range interactions. Moreover, we consider several examples of magnetic and structural phase transitions, which are described by more complex Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonians, such as N-component systems with cubic anisotropy, O( N)-symmetric systems in the presence of quenched disorder, frustrated spin systems with
noncollinear or canted order, and finally, a class of systems described by the tetragonal Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian with three quartic couplings. The results for the tetragonal Hamiltonian are original, in particular we present the six-loop perturbative series for the

We analyze the stability of the fixed points using a Borel transformation and a conformal mapping that takes into account the singularities of the Borel transform. We find that the cubic fixed point is stable for N{\textgreater}Nc, Nc=2.89(4). Therefore, the critical properties of cubic ferromagnets are not described by the Heisenberg isotropic Hamiltonian, but instead by the cubic model at the cubic fixed point. For N=3, the critical exponents at the cubic and symmetric fixed points differ very little (less than the precision of our results, which is ≲1\% in the case of γ and ν). Moreover, the irrelevant interaction bringing from the symmetric to the cubic fixed point gives rise to slowly decaying scaling corrections with exponent ω2=0.010(4). For N=2, the isotropic fixed point is stable and the cubic interaction induces scaling corrections with exponent ω2=0.103(8). These conclusions are confirmed by a similar analysis of the five-loop ε expansion. A constrained analysis, which takes into account that Nc=2 in two dimensions, gives Nc=2.87(5).},

	abstract = {I study a simple variation of the algorithm of Metropolis et al. for simulating statistical systems. The trial changes in any given variable are taken from a region of phase space far from the old value but involving only small changes in energy. This results in correlation times which are short compared to the usual applications of the algorithm of Metropolis et al. Tests with {SU}(2) and {SU}(3) lattice gauge theories indicate substantial possible savings in computation time relative to standard approaches.},
